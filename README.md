# C++ Object-Oriented Programming Exercises

This repository contains a collection of C++ exercises and assignments focused on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), completed as part of academic coursework and practical seminars.

## 📚 About the Project

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate a solid understanding of fundamental and advanced OOP principles in C++. The exercises range from basic class design to more complex implementations involving inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, abstraction, and more.

Each file or folder represents a standalone task or assignment aimed at practicing specific concepts of C++ OOP.
